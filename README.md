I am learning and developing a project step by step, as demonstrated in the book 'Django 4 by example'. Original:  https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Django-4-by-example
Everything, except the .css static file, was created by me, without copy-pasting.
All the process was commited step-by-step so you can see.
